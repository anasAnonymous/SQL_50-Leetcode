## Example

### Problem
A country is considered big if it has an area of at least 3 million kmÂ² or a population of at least 25 million. Write a SQL query to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

### Input
#### World table:
```
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
```

#### Output:
```
| name        | population | area    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM world 
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

SQL Schema

Table: World

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |
+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:
- it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
- it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).

Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
World table:
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+

Output: 
+-------------+------------+---------+
| name        | population | area    |
+-------------+------------+---------+
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
+-------------+------------+---------+


Solution:

SELECT name, population, area
FROM world 
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000
